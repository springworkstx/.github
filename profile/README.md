**Let’s wage science.**

We are committed to finding answers people with cancer need. We thrive in an atmosphere of passion and tenacity, fueled by the excitement of the possibilities science may unlock and driven to work with urgency because of the importance of our work. We value authenticity because diverse backgrounds, cultures, styles and abilities can only help us unlock the full potential of targeted oncology.

**Tenacity needs a set of values to guide it.**

Our core values guide how we work, who we hire and how we measure our performance. We know that finding the answers for people with cancer will take equal measures of relentless determination and no-ego collaboration — our values help us stay focused and accountable every day on behalf of the people we’re trying to help.
